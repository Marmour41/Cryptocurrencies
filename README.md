# Cryptocurrencies
This purpose of this project was to create an unsupervized machine learning model using cryptocurrency data. The data was prepared, processed, and transformed to obtain a usable dataset. Next, I reduced the dimensions and clustered the data using PCA and K-Means. Finally, I created a 3-D scatter plot to visualize the clusters.
